<span class="doccomment">//! Rust implementation of double-double and quad-double high-precision floating point</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! numbers.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The most precise floating-point type in Rust (and most languages) is 64 bits, which</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! gives around 15 decimal digits of precision. This is fine for nearly all applications,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! but sometimes a little more is needed.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The choices are limited for higher-precision floating-point numbers. One choice is to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! use 128-bit floating-point numbers, but Rust (and most languages outside Fortran and a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! few C++ flavors) doesn&#39;t have them.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! A second choice is an arbitary-precision library. These are fantastic in that they can</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! do computations in any precision you choose, even into the thousands or millions of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! digits. Their downside is that internally they use something like character arrays to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! represent numbers, so they have to essentially re-implement math for that internal</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! representation. This is slow.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Fortunately, while a lot of applications need more than the language-provided precision,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! they don&#39;t need as much as arbitrary-precision has to offer. For those cases there is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! another choice: representing high-precision numbers as unevaluated sums of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! lower-precision numbers. This choice will give precision in multiples of system-provided</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! number precisions, and while math with these numbers is slower than with regular</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! numbers, it&#39;s much faster than arbitrary precision. These sorts of numbers are what this</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! library provides.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Double-double and quad-double numbers</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The numbers provided by this library are double-doubles, represented by two `f64`s, and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! quad-doubles, represented by four `f64`s. The names &quot;double-double&quot; and &quot;quad-double&quot;</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! come from IEEE-754 double-precision floating point numbers and are the names used for</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! these numbers the most in literature. Therefore those names are retained even though</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Rust represents *its* doubles with `f64`. Every effort has been put into making them</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! work as much like `f64`s as possible.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The `Double` type (double-double) has 106 bits of significand, meaning about 31 decimal</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! digits, while the `Quad` type (quad-double) has 212 bits (about 63 decimal digits).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! However, the exponents remain the same as in `f64`, so the range of each type is similar</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! to `f64` (max value of around ~10&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;). These types don&#39;t make *bigger*</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! numbers, they make *more precise* numbers.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! For those who are interested, a paper from MIT called [Library for Double-Double and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Quad-Double Arithmetic][1] explains the algorithms for working with these numbers in</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! great detail, and that paper plus their C++ implementation were absolutely invaluable in</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! writing this library.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Using double-double and quad-double numbers</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! `qd` provides a pair of macros, [`dd!`][2] and [`qd!`][3], which can be used to create</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! double-doubles and quad-doubles, respectively. These macros will take any primitive</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! number type (`dd!` cannot take `u128` or `i128`, as there would be a *loss* of precision</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! to turn those into double-doubles) or a string containing a number that can be</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! represented (if the string contains more digits than can be accurately represented by</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the type, the extra digits will be ignored).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Once you have a double-double or a quad-double, you can use it just like you would an</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! `f64`: all of the mathematical operators work on them, the vast majority of methods</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! work, etc. (see the rest of this documentation for the full API). Each type has a full</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! `Display` implementation, meaning that you can use formatting strings with `format!`,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! `println!` and the like with all of the formatting options that are available with</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! `f64`.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! It&#39;s important to note that double-doubles and quad-doubles are incompatible with each</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! other and with other numbers, short of options to directly convert one to another. In</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! other words, you can&#39;t add an `f64` to a `Double` (though you can convert the `f64` to a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! `Double` and then add them), and you can&#39;t multiply a `Quad` by an `i32` (though once</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! again, you can convert the `i32` to a `Quad` and then do it). This is typical of type</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! casting in Rust (you also can&#39;t add an `f64` and an `f32` together) and actually makes</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! it less insanity-inducing when reading code with a lot of different number types.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Normalization</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Since double-doubles and quad-doubles are represented as sums, there is actually an</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! infinite number of ways to represent any of them. For example, 0 could be represented</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! as (0, 0), (1, -1), (π, -π), or any other such pair.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! This creates a problem if for no other reason than that figuring out what number is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! equal to whatever other number becomes really hard when an infinite number of pairs all</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! might be equal (there are plenty of other reasons, too). For that reason, we normalize</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! all double-doubles and quad-doubles.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Normalizing a number ensures that each component after the first has an absolute value</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! of 0.5 times the lowest-placed unit of the component before it (ULP, unit in the last</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! place) or less. For example, the first component of π is 3.141592653589793. The ULP of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! this number is 10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt;, as that final 3 is 15 places after the decimal. The</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! next component must therefore have an absolute value less than or equal to half that, or</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! 5 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-16&lt;/sup&gt;. Indeed, the second component of π is 1.2246467991473532</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-16&lt;/sup&gt;.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Each number&#39;s normalized form is unique. The number 0 as a double-double is (0, 0).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! There is no other pair of components that satisfies the criteria for normalization.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Since the form is now unique, comparisons can be made easily, arithmetic can be done</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! efficiently, and generally everything works better.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! </span>
<span class="doccomment">//! *Nearly* every function in qd normalizes when necessary. The sole exceptions are</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! [`Double::raw`][4] and [`Quad::raw`][5], which specifically skip normalization and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! should only be used on numbers that are already known to be normalized.</span>
