<span class="doccomment">//! Rust implementation of double-double and quad-double high-precision floating point numbers.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The most precise floating-point type in Rust (and most languages) is 64 bits, which gives around</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! 15 decimal digits of precision. This is fine for nearly all applications, but sometimes a little</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! more is needed.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The choices are limited for higher-precision floating-point numbers. One choice is to use</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! 128-bit floating-point numbers, but Rust (and most languages outside Fortran and a few C++</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! flavors) doesn&#39;t have them.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! A second choice is an arbitary-precision library. These are fantastic in that they can do</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! computations in any precision you choose, even into the thousands or millions of digits. Their</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! downside is that internally they use something like character arrays to represent numbers, so</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! they have to essentially re-implement math for that internal representation. This is slow.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Fortunately, while a lot of applications need more than the language-provided precision, they</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! don&#39;t need as much as arbitrary-precision has to offer. For those cases there is another choice:</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! representing high-precision numbers as sums of lower-precision numbers. This choice will give</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! precision in multiples of system-provided number precisions, and while math with these numbers</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! is slower than with regular numbers, it&#39;s much faster than arbitrary precision. These sorts of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! numbers are what this library provides.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Double-double and quad-double numbers</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The numbers provided by this library are double-doubles, represented by two `f64`s, and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! quad-doubles, represented by four `f64`s. Every effort has been put into making them work as</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! much like `f64`s as possible.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The `Double` type has 106 bits of significand, meaning about 31 decimal digits, while the `Quad`</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! type has 212 bits (about 63 decimal digits). However, the exponents remain the same as in `f64`,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! so the range of each type is similar to `f64` (max value of around ~10&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;). These</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! types don&#39;t make *bigger* numbers, they make *more precise* numbers.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! For those who are interested, a paper from MIT called [Library for Double-Double and Quad-Double</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Arithmetic][1] explains the algorithms for working with these numbers in great detail, and that</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! paper plus their C++ implementation were absolutely invaluable in writing this library.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Using double-double and quad-double numbers</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! `qd` provides a pair of macros, [`dd!`] and `qd!`, which can be used to create double-doubles</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! and quad-doubles, respectively. These macros will take any primitive number type (`dd!` cannot</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! take `u128` or `i128`, as there would be a *loss* of precision to turn those into</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! double-doubles) or a string containing a number that can be represented (if the string contains</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! more digits than can be accurately represented by the type, the extra digits will be ignored).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Once you have a double-double or a quad-double, you can use it just like you would an `f64`: all</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! of the mathematical operators work on them, the vast majority of methods work, etc. (see the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! rest of this documentation for the full API). Each type has a full `Display` implementation,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! meaning that you can use formatting strings with `format!`, `println!` and the like with all of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the formatting options that are available with `f64`.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! It&#39;s important to note that double-doubles and quad-doubles are incompatible with each other and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! with other numbers, short of options to directly convert one to another. In other words, you</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! can&#39;t add an `f64` to a `Double` (though you can convert the `f64` to a `Double` and then add</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! them), and you can&#39;t multiply a `Quad` by an `i32` (though once again, you can convert the `i32`</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! to a `Quad` and then do it). This is typical of type casting in Rust (you also can&#39;t add an</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! `f64` and an `f32` together) and actually makes it less insanity-inducing when reading code with</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! a lot of different number types.</span>
