numbers.</p>
<p>The most precise floating-point type in Rust (and most languages) is 64 bits, which
gives around 15 decimal digits of precision. This is fine for nearly all applications,
but sometimes a little more is needed.</p>
<p>The choices are limited for higher-precision floating-point numbers. One choice is to
use 128-bit floating-point numbers, but Rust (and most languages outside Fortran and a
few C++ flavors) doesn't have them.</p>
<p>A second choice is an arbitary-precision library. These are fantastic in that they can
do computations in any precision you choose, even into the thousands or millions of
digits. Their downside is that internally they use something like character arrays to
represent numbers, so they have to essentially re-implement math for that internal
representation. This is slow.</p>
<p>Fortunately, while a lot of applications need more than the language-provided precision,
they don't need as much as arbitrary-precision has to offer. For those cases there is
another choice: representing high-precision numbers as unevaluated sums of
lower-precision numbers. This choice will give precision in multiples of system-provided
number precisions, and while math with these numbers is slower than with regular
numbers, it's much faster than arbitrary precision. These sorts of numbers are what this
library provides.</p>
<h1 id="double-double-and-quad-double-numbers" class="section-header"><a href="#double-double-and-quad-double-numbers">Double-double and quad-double numbers</a></h1>
<p>The numbers provided by this library are double-doubles, represented by two <code>f64</code>s, and
quad-doubles, represented by four <code>f64</code>s. The names &quot;double-double&quot; and &quot;quad-double&quot;
come from IEEE-754 double-precision floating point numbers and are the names used for
these numbers the most in literature. Therefore those names are retained even though
Rust represents <em>its</em> doubles with <code>f64</code>. Every effort has been put into making them
work as much like <code>f64</code>s as possible.</p>
<p>The <code>Double</code> type (double-double) has 106 bits of significand, meaning about 31 decimal
digits, while the <code>Quad</code> type (quad-double) has 212 bits (about 63 decimal digits).
However, the exponents remain the same as in <code>f64</code>, so the range of each type is similar
to <code>f64</code> (max value of around ~10<sup>308</sup>). These types don't make <em>bigger</em>
numbers, they make <em>more precise</em> numbers.</p>
<p>For those who are interested, a paper from MIT called <a href="http://web.mit.edu/tabbott/Public/quaddouble-debian/qd-2.3.4-old/docs/qd.pdf">Library for Double-Double and
Quad-Double Arithmetic</a> explains the algorithms for working with these numbers in
great detail, and that paper plus their C++ implementation were absolutely invaluable in
writing this library.</p>
<h1 id="using-double-double-and-quad-double-numbers" class="section-header"><a href="#using-double-double-and-quad-double-numbers">Using double-double and quad-double numbers</a></h1>
<p><code>qd</code> provides a pair of macros, <a href="macros.dd.html"><code>dd!</code></a> and <a href="macros.qd.html"><code>qd!</code></a>, which can be used to create
double-doubles and quad-doubles, respectively. These macros will take any primitive
number type (<code>dd!</code> cannot take <code>u128</code> or <code>i128</code>, as there would be a <em>loss</em> of precision
to turn those into double-doubles) or a string containing a number that can be
represented (if the string contains more digits than can be accurately represented by
the type, the extra digits will be ignored).</p>
<p>Once you have a double-double or a quad-double, you can use it just like you would an
<code>f64</code>: all of the mathematical operators work on them, the vast majority of methods
work, etc. (see the rest of this documentation for the full API). Each type has a full
<code>Display</code> implementation, meaning that you can use formatting strings with <code>format!</code>,
<code>println!</code> and the like with all of the formatting options that are available with
<code>f64</code>.</p>
<p>It's important to note that double-doubles and quad-doubles are incompatible with each
other and with other numbers, short of options to directly convert one to another. In
other words, you can't add an <code>f64</code> to a <code>Double</code> (though you can convert the <code>f64</code> to a
<code>Double</code> and then add them), and you can't multiply a <code>Quad</code> by an <code>i32</code> (though once
again, you can convert the <code>i32</code> to a <code>Quad</code> and then do it). This is typical of type
casting in Rust (you also can't add an <code>f64</code> and an <code>f32</code> together) and actually makes
it less insanity-inducing when reading code with a lot of different number types.</p>
<h1 id="normalization" class="section-header"><a href="#normalization">Normalization</a></h1>
<p>Since double-doubles and quad-doubles are represented as sums, there is actually an
infinite number of ways to represent any of them. For example, 0 could be represented
as (0, 0), (1, -1), (π, -π), or any other such pair.</p>
<p>This creates a problem if for no other reason than that figuring out what number is
equal to whatever other number becomes really hard when an infinite number of pairs all
might be equal (there are plenty of other reasons, too). For that reason, we normalize
all double-doubles and quad-doubles.</p>
<p>Normalizing a number ensures that each component after the first has an absolute value
of 0.5 times the lowest-placed unit of the component before it (ULP, unit in the last
place) or less. For example, the first component of π is 3.141592653589793. The ULP of
this number is 10<sup>-15</sup>, as that final 3 is 15 places after the decimal. The
next component must therefore have an absolute value less than or equal to half that, or
5 × 10<sup>-16</sup>. Indeed, the second component of π is 1.2246467991473532
× 10<sup>-16</sup>.</p>
<p>Each number's normalized form is unique. The number 0 as a double-double is (0, 0).
There is no other pair of components that satisfies the criteria for normalization.
Since the form is now unique, comparisons can be made easily, arithmetic can be done
efficiently, and generally everything works better.</p>
<p><em>Nearly</em> every function in qd normalizes when necessary. The sole exceptions are
<a href="struct.Double.html#methods.raw"><code>Double::raw</code></a> and <a href="struct.Quad.html:methods.raw"><code>Quad::raw</code></a>, which specifically skip normalization and
should only be used on numbers that are already known to be normalized.</p>
