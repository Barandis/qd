<p>The most precise floating-point type in Rust (and most languages) is 64 bits, which gives around
15 decimal digits of precision. This is fine for nearly all applications, but sometimes a little
more is needed.</p>
<p>The choices are limited for higher-precision floating-point numbers. One choice is to use
128-bit floating-point numbers, but Rust (and most languages outside Fortran and a few C++
flavors) doesn't have them.</p>
<p>A second choice is an arbitary-precision library. These are fantastic in that they can do
computations in any precision you choose, even into the thousands or millions of digits. Their
downside is that internally they use something like character arrays to represent numbers, so
they have to essentially re-implement math for that internal representation. This is slow.</p>
<p>Fortunately, while a lot of applications need more than the language-provided precision, they
don't need as much as arbitrary-precision has to offer. For those cases there is another choice:
representing high-precision numbers as sums of lower-precision numbers. This choice will give
precision in multiples of system-provided number precisions, and while math with these numbers
is slower than with regular numbers, it's much faster than arbitrary precision. These sorts of
numbers are what this library provides.</p>
<h1 id="double-double-and-quad-double-numbers" class="section-header"><a href="#double-double-and-quad-double-numbers">Double-double and quad-double numbers</a></h1>
<p>The numbers provided by this library are double-doubles, represented by two <code>f64</code>s, and
quad-doubles, represented by four <code>f64</code>s. Every effort has been put into making them work as
much like <code>f64</code>s as possible.</p>
<p>The <code>Double</code> type has 106 bits of significand, meaning about 31 decimal digits, while the <code>Quad</code>
type has 212 bits (about 63 decimal digits). However, the exponents remain the same as in <code>f64</code>,
so the range of each type is similar to <code>f64</code> (max value of around ~10<sup>308</sup>). These
types don't make <em>bigger</em> numbers, they make <em>more precise</em> numbers.</p>
<p>For those who are interested, a paper from MIT called <a href="http://web.mit.edu/tabbott/Public/quaddouble-debian/qd-2.3.4-old/docs/qd.pdf">Library for Double-Double and Quad-Double
Arithmetic</a> explains the algorithms for working with these numbers in great detail, and that
paper plus their C++ implementation were absolutely invaluable in writing this library.</p>
<h1 id="using-double-double-and-quad-double-numbers" class="section-header"><a href="#using-double-double-and-quad-double-numbers">Using double-double and quad-double numbers</a></h1>
<p><code>qd</code> provides a pair of macros, <a href="macros.dd.html"><code>dd!</code></a> and <code>qd!</code>, which can be used to create double-doubles
and quad-doubles, respectively. These macros will take any primitive number type (<code>dd!</code> cannot
take <code>u128</code> or <code>i128</code>, as there would be a <em>loss</em> of precision to turn those into
double-doubles) or a string containing a number that can be represented (if the string contains
more digits than can be accurately represented by the type, the extra digits will be ignored).</p>
<p>Once you have a double-double or a quad-double, you can use it just like you would an <code>f64</code>: all
of the mathematical operators work on them, the vast majority of methods work, etc. (see the
rest of this documentation for the full API). Each type has a full <code>Display</code> implementation,
meaning that you can use formatting strings with <code>format!</code>, <code>println!</code> and the like with all of
the formatting options that are available with <code>f64</code>.</p>
<p>It's important to note that double-doubles and quad-doubles are incompatible with each other and
with other numbers, short of options to directly convert one to another. In other words, you
can't add an <code>f64</code> to a <code>Double</code> (though you can convert the <code>f64</code> to a <code>Double</code> and then add
them), and you can't multiply a <code>Quad</code> by an <code>i32</code> (though once again, you can convert the <code>i32</code>
to a <code>Quad</code> and then do it). This is typical of type casting in Rust (you also can't add an
<code>f64</code> and an <code>f32</code> together) and actually makes it less insanity-inducing when reading code with
a lot of different number types.</p>
