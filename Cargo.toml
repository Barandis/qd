[features]
default = []

# This feature disables the use of the f64 `mul_add` function when doing high-precision multiplication. `mul_add` falls
# back to a slow method of calculating a * b + c if the processor does not have an FMA (fused multiply and add)
# instruction available.
#
# This crate contains a multiplication algorithm that is not as fast as with FMA, but is faster than using `mul_add`
# without FMA. Enabling this feature will use that algorithm. It's recommended to do so only if your processor does not
# have an FMA instruction.
#
# There is no FMA instruction (yet) in WebAssembly, so it's completely reasonable to use this feature if wasm is your
# target.
